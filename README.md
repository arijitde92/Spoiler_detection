This repository contains code to train a simple Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) using [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)'s MLP model.
It uses [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to preprocess the dataset and perform NLP tasks like tokenization, named entity recognition.

To run you need to have jupyter notebook installed along with spacy, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas and tqdm packages.
To quickly install the required packages, run
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
