# Spoiler Detection
This repository contains code to train a simple Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) using [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)'s MLP model.<br>
It uses [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to preprocess the dataset and perform NLP tasks like tokenization, named entity recognition.

To run you need to have jupyter notebook installed along with spacy, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas and tqdm packages.<br>
To quickly install the required packages, run<br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

After that, you need to download the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/imdb-spoiler-dataset/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/imdb-spoiler-dataset/data), extract it into a folder called `data`.
<br>
Now you can run the notebook.
